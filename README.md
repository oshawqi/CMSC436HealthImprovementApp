Project Ideas
1. Calorie Tracking application
a. User enters their calorie goal for the day
b. They enter their food intake/calories for each meal
c. The application tries to remind them to eat/not eat depending on their intake for the day
2. Workout Challenge
a. User uses a predefined or entered workout
b. User can send workouts to their group/friends to challenge them
c. Workouts could be rated to add competition
d. Workouts could also just be sent as challenges with points for completing them.
e. Possibly add networking at the end, for now implement it as a workout planner / advice application
3. Health App for COVID pandemic Students
a. Implement a calendar to allow them to schedule their week
b. Allow them to section off how long a certain assignment would take. 
c. Use alarms/notifications to remind them to move, eat, drink, etc. during the day. 
d. Could optimize their schedule for the week.


General Rules
1. Split the project up by activities
2. Write tests after finishing a portion of the project so that further code can be checked properly.
3. Check that your code passes all the tests before committing it on git.


From MainActivity.kt
/*"Weight Room" workout app by Owen Knott, Philip Corn, Omar Shawqi for UMD CMSC436 Fall2020
    This app is meant to provide users a means of creating and recording custom workouts
    to keep their bodies healthy.
    Future functionality could include:
        1. A means of "challenging" friends by sending a workout to them
        2. A system of timers for cardiovascular workouts
        3. Specific instructions and videos on how to safely perform basic workouts

    Special thanks to the CMSC436 lab code, especially for the user authentication, adapters,
    and realtime database starter code. This was modified heavily with help from Firebase.org's
    docs to create the app as it currently stands.
